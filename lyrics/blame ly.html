<h1>Stuck in my ways, yuh<br>
    Sleeping all day (It's Swidom)<br>
    And I need to change<br>
    Baby I'm to blame<br>
    I'm so stuck in my ways, baby I can't change<br>
    I've been sleeping all day from my nights up late<br>
    I'm gon' tell you I'm fine but I'm not okay<br>
    Baby it's a fine line, I can't walk away<br>
    Going out my mind, feeling out of place<br>
    I can't check my phone, baby I need space<br>
    I've been locked away, in my mental cage<br>
    But I can't point no fingers, baby I'm to blame, blame<br>
    You ever been so down you lay out in the rain<br>
    Mud soaking through your shirt<br>
    But you don't care about the stains (Oh no)<br>
    You ever felt that all your problems in your head<br>
    And nobody could relate<br>
    Ain't no matter what you say, whoa (Oh no)<br>
    I've tried to leave before but it was all in vain<br>
    Cause I'm already dead, got no option but to stay whoa (Oh no)<br>
    Decide to leave for me another that's okay<br>
    Cause I've been so alone, I won't notice anyway<br>
    Nineteen but I wanna live lavish<br>
    Hard to move fast with all this baggage<br>
    Swallowing down another tabletv<br>
    Plagued by self destructive habits<br>
    Quick check, do I wanna be famous?<br>
    Yeah, but I know that life is dangerous<br>
    Cut me with your expectations<br>
    Blood on my unwritten pages<br>
    Torn out of my book, my flight to nowhere<br>
    Five days go by, I really don't care<br>
    Can't right my wrongs, I know it's unfair (I know it's unfair)<br>
    If I go MIA I'm gon' be back<br>
    Can't wait to see how the people react<br>
    I'll take this time off and work on myself<br>
    That's gon' be best for my health<br>
    I'm so stuck in my ways, baby I can't change<br>
    I've been sleeping all day from my nights up late<br>
    I'm gon' tell you I'm fine but I'm not okay<br>
    Baby it's a fine line, I can't walk away<br>
    Going out my mind, feeling out of place<br>
    I can't check my phone, baby I need space<br>
    I've been locked away, in my mental cage<br>
    But I can't point no fingers, baby I'm to blame, blame<br>
    I can't help myself no I can't change<br>
    I watch my health go down the drain<br>
    You look at me like I'm insane<br>
    I'm to blame, blame<br>
