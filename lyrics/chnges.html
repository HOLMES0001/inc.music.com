<h1>I've been going through some changes<br>
    Wandering around hella aimless<br>
    Can't even remember what my name is<br>
    (I've been going through some changes)<br>
    I think the last time I was this faded<br>
    You said that our love was jaded<br>
    You know I hate being separated<br>
    Can't take anymore of these changes, changes yeah<br>
    (King, this shit fuego)<br>

    changes<br>
    Everything I knew you went and changed it<br>
    Even took my heart and rearranged it<br>
    Who'da thought that you could be so dangerous, dangerous woah<br>
    (I've been going through some) heartache<br>
    I know you didn't mean to make my heartbreak<br>
    But now I gotta deal with it the hard way<br>
    Now every single day's another hard day<br>
    Another hard day (I've been going through some)<br>
    Maybe my words mean something to you<br>
    Maybe they don't<br>
    Who really knows<br>
    Or maybe to you I'm just another heartbreak<br>
    Another heartache<br>
