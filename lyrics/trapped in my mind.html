<h1> Yung Ting, you going crazy<br>
Oh no, no (King, this shit fuego)<br>
Can't breathe in toxic skies<br>
Pollute me with your lies<br>
I thought that I died (Woah, woah)<br>
I cannot breathe through toxic skies<br>
You pollute me with your lies<br>
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time<br>
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind<br>
I can't escape even if I tried<br>
Too little too late too weak and too kind<br>
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive<br>
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind<br>
I don't know the date been in my mind for days<br>
Wish I could get away<br>
You know it isn't safe for me to be in this headspace<br>
(Ayy, yeah, yeah)<br>
Drunk and I miss you unless I'm just drunk<br>
Told me to swim then you watched as I sunk<br>
I can't forgive you no I'm not that dumb<br>
Paranoid I gotta run<br>
I cannot breathe through toxic skies<br>
You pollute me with your lies<br>
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time<br>
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind<br>
I can't escape even if I tried<br>
Too little too late too weak and too kind<br>
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive<br>
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind<br>
Once upon a time I used to hold you close<br>
Now the only thing I'm holdin' is a broken soul<br>
Knocked me down and I'm still falling like some domino's<br>
Oh no I'm trapped I can't get out no more<br>
Back to the basics you crazy as hell<br>
And I can't bring to myself to say I wish you well<br>
Tryna be tough in a world that's ablaze<br>
You told me that you would stay<br>
I cannot breathe through toxic skies<br>
You pollute me with your lies<br>
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time<br>
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind<br>
I can't escape even if I tried<br>
Too little too late too weak and too kind<br>
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive<br>
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind<br>
Singing why, oh why<br>
You lie, you lie<br>
Everytime, everytime<br>
I die a little inside<br>
I'm like bye, baby baby bye bye<br>
Gotta move on with my life<br>
Well at least I'm gon' try<br>
Don't you hit me in the night<br>
Cause I'm probably home cryin'<br>
Don't you know that I'm<br>
Still trapped in my mind<br>
I cannot breathe through toxic skies<br>
You pollute me with your lies<br>
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time<br>
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind<br>
I can't escape even if I tried<br>
Too little too late too weak and too kind<br>
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive<br>
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind<br>
Can't breathe in toxic skies<br>
Pollute me with your lies<br>
I thought that I died (Woah, woah)<br>
Oh no, no </h1>
